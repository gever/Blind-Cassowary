# Blind Cassowary

"The game that will never take off, and when it does, it won't know where it's going." -Sylvia Zoyt, Blind Cassowary Cabal

## The Rules

The deck consists of 52 cards plus two jokers. The jokers are referred to as "chameleons" because they can become any other card that you have in your hand. In notation here, the chameleon is referred to as C, and J is Jack, Q is Queen, K is King.

### To Start
1. Deal five cards to each player at the table. Once all players have been dealt their hands, two cards are flipped over to reveal the target - *the digits of the target must be placed in the order they were drawn*. For example, if an 8 and a 5 are drawn, the target is 85 (see the **Special Rules** for how to handle/interpret 10's and face cards in the target). Place the target cards side-by-side near the "reserve" (the undealt cards). As play progresses, players will draw cards as required or needed, so everyone should be able to reach the reserve.
2. Play begins once everyone agrees on the target and has had a moment to think about the properties of that particular number - only after this may players look at their hands. Note that hands may be played open or closed (hidden from other players) as individual players desire.

### Play
The goal of each player is to compose mathematical equations that evaluate to the target value. A set of cards that achieve this goal is called a "cassowary". Players do this using the cards in their hand and the basic arithmetic operators:

| operator | formula | notes                           | 
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| +        | a + b   | the sum of cards a and b        |
| -        | a - b   | the difference of cards a and b |
| ÷        | a ÷ b   | the dividing of a by b          |
| ✕        | a ✕ b   | the multiplying of a by b       |
| ^        | a ^ b   | the raising a to the power b    |

*note: parenthesis are implied where needed to make the equation of the cassowary work, and are often illustrated by positioning the cards as the formula is explained*

It is important to note that there are no "turns" in Blind Cassowary. Play moves along at the pace at which players can form valid cassowaries. For example, if the target is 24 and a players hand contains 4, 6, 3, Q, 2 there are at least four ways to cassowary: (4 x 6), (2 x Q), (2 x 3 x 4), ((6 x 3) + 4 + 2), and probably more that could be achieved.

Having formed a valid cassowary, the player will announce "cassowary" and then will show their solution inviting others to confirm their calculations. At this point in play anyone may request that the player explain their solution. If there are no corrections from other players at the table, or from spectators in the vicinity, the other players each draw a card from the reserves, and the player replenishes their hand to maintain a minimum of five cards (until the end-of-game phase begins).

After getting the nod of approval (which, over time, and between players of good character, may become perfunctory), the player lays their solution in their "nest" (alternating ordinal directions between solutions so as to allow easy counting or challenge later). They then replenish their hand with cards from the reserve.

Note that during play, any player's hand may hold more than five cards due to other players laying cassowary. For example, a player with eight cards in their hand, who lays a two-card cassowary, would not replenish because they still have more (8-2=6) than the minimum card count (50 in their hand.

Play continues until the reserves are completely depleted, at which point the game is seen to be transitioning into the end-of-game phase. Players may continue to make cassowary even though there are no cards in the reserve to replenish from. When no player can manage to lay a cassowary, all players are considered "stuck."

### End of Game
Before the final scoring begins, players use what cards remain in their hands to create solutions that come as close as possible to the target *without going over*. The solution that comes closest is awarded a single bonus point. In the event of two or more players hitting the same close target, they are each awarded a point. Because they do not hit the target number, these last plays are referred to as the "blind cassowary".

### Scoring
There are two ways of computing the score of a nest (and this should be decided before play begins):
1. **Simple Score**: the count of cassowaries in the player's nest is their score for the round.
2. **Composite Score**: the count of cards in the player's nest is their score for the round. *Composite Scoring is the de facto standard by agreement of the Blind Cassowary Cabal.*
   
Additionally, "Big Cassowary" points may be awarded for the largest (by count of cards) single cassowary in the round. The player with the largest cassowary in their nest is given additional points equal to the number of cards in that cassowary. If agreed to before play starts, points may also be give for "Best in Show" cassowary as voted on by the players and spectators at the table - in which case players must nominate their own cassowary for consideration.

### Interpretation of Cards
In the context of a cassowary, Ace is 1, the ordinal cards are at their ordinal value, Jack is 11, Queen is 12, King is 13. It is important to remember that a chameleon is not a fully wild card and can only "be" one of the other cards in a player's hand.

## Special Rules
1. **Drunk Chameleon** - if a player is left with only a Chameleon at the end of the round, this is called the "Drunk Chameleon" (because it doesn't know what it wants to be) and that player **loses 2 points.**
2. **Face Cards in the Target** - there are two ways to handle the appearance of face cards and tens in the target number:
	1. *Method One* - sophisticated players apply the following rules in order.
		1. If face card is first and the number card is second, the number card is added to the face card to create a two-digit target. For example, if you pulled K & 3, that's considered 16, K & 7 is 20, and so forth for all cards less than ten.
		2. If number card is first and face card second, you add the number card to tens-place on the face card to create a two-digit target. For example, if you pulled 8 & J, that's considered 91, and if you got 7 & K, that's 83, and so forth for all cards less than ten.
		3. "The Curse" you have a ten and a face card, or two face cards; this is considered "a cursed hand" and you will have a 3 digit target. The solution here is to multiply the first card by 10 and add the next card, so a K goes from 13 to 130. For example, if you have K & J, that's 130 + 11 giving a target of 141. J & K becomes 110 + 13 for a target of 123. Similarly 10 and J becomes 100 + 11 for a target of 111. *Note that there is a possibility of getting a chameleon and a face card or ten, in which case you are "doubly cursed" and the target becomes the concatenation of the digits of the non-chameleon. For example, if you had J and C, you have two Queens (aka 12) and they give you a target of 1,212 - good luck!*
		4. "Upper Canopy" 
	2. *Method Two* - "Deal With It"
		1. Whenever a face card appears, continue to draw cards until a single digit card is showing

## Special Notes
1. Invalid cassowaries can happen by accident or by intention; trying to pass off an intentionally bad cassowary is seen as nefarious and may result in exclusion from the game or loss of score (ten points or more depending on the moral and ethical context).
